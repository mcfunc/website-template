# Webstack Template

A reusable, modular web application template organized into 6 sequential development stages with strict dependency management. Each stage delivers a complete, functional slice that can be independently tested and deployed.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build and start the stack
docker-compose up --build

# Stop the stack
docker-compose down

# Complete redeploy
./deploy.sh restart
```

## Development Commands

### Setup & Deployment
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
./deploy.sh restart  # Complete redeploy
```

### Testing & Quality
```bash
npm test             # Run full test suite
npm run lint         # Run linting
npm run typecheck    # Run type checking
npm run test:api     # API integration tests
```

### Database
```bash
npm run migrate      # Run database migrations
npm run seed         # Seed database with test data
```

## Architecture Overview

### Stage-Based Development

**Stage 0: Core Infrastructure & Security Baseline**
- Docker setup with docker-compose.yml
- Deployment scripts and CI/CD pipeline
- Basic web app structure
- *Technologies: Docker, GitHub Actions, Node.js*

**Stage 1: Authentication & User Foundation**
- Modular SSO login system
- Secure user/account storage with encryption
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging
- *Technologies: OAuth2/OpenID Connect, Auth0, PostgreSQL, JWT*

**Stage 2: Basic User Features**
- User profile settings
- Notification preferences
- Public landing page
- *Technologies: React, Redux/Context API, Chart.js*

**Stage 3: Core API Integration & Data Pipeline**
- External REST API integration
- Data transformation and storage
- Redis caching layer
- Automated data fetching with rate limiting
- *Technologies: Axios, Redis, PostgreSQL, BullMQ, Sentry*

**Stage 4: Theming & Modular System**
- Centralized theming system
- Plugin API contract
- Feature toggles
- Hot-swappable themes
- *Technologies: CSS variables, Tailwind CSS, Webpack, LaunchDarkly*

**Stage 5: Admin & Analytics Foundation**
- Admin dashboard with metrics
- A/B testing system
- Load balancing and microservices
- *Technologies: Ant Design/MUI, Nginx/HAProxy, Kubernetes, Prometheus*

**Stage 6: Advanced User Experience**
- Modular dashboard widgets
- Real-time alerts via WebSocket
- Advanced analytics
- *Technologies: D3.js, Socket.IO, Redis Pub/Sub*

## Key Features

### Security
- AES-256 encryption for user data storage
- JWT tokens with secure refresh mechanisms
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Comprehensive audit logging

### Modularity
- Plugin system with feature toggles
- Pluggable SSO provider modules
- Hot-swappable themes
- Dynamic module loading

### Data Flow
1. External API integration with OAuth2
2. Data transformation and normalization
3. Historical storage with Redis caching
4. Real-time WebSocket streaming
5. KPI calculations and analytics

## Development Guidelines

### Stage Dependencies
Each stage must be completed and tested before proceeding to the next. The dependency chain ensures proper foundation building from infrastructure through advanced features.

### Testing Strategy
- Full test deployment required after each stage
- Generic API integration test suite
- Component testing for React UI
- Integration testing for authentication flows

### Deployment Architecture
- Single environment deployment
- Docker containerization with docker-compose
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Load balancing for production scaling
