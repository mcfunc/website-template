# Update profile information  
PUT /api/user/profile
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "display_name": "John Doe",
  "bio": "Software developer passionate about building great user experiences",
  "location": "San Francisco, CA",
  "website_url": "https://johndoe.dev",
  "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",

  "marketing_emails": false,
  "frequency": "daily",
  "quiet_hours_start": "22:00",
  "quiet_hours_end": "08:00"
}
```

### User Activity & Analytics
```bash
# Get user activity history
GET /api/user/activity?limit=20&offset=0&type=profile_updated

# Get user statistics
