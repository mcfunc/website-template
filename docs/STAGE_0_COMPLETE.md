# Stage 0: Core Infrastructure & Security Baseline - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Stage 0 has been successfully completed and deployed. This stage establishes the foundation infrastructure that all subsequent stages will build upon.

## Completed Components

### 🐳 Docker Infrastructure
- **docker-compose.yml**: Multi-service orchestration with webapp, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Nginx
- **Environment Configuration**: `.env` files with secure defaults and production templates
- **Multi-stage Dockerfile**: Optimized Node.js React application with security hardening

### 🚀 Deployment Automation  
- **deploy.sh**: Comprehensive deployment script with start/stop/restart/test operations
- **Health Checks**: Automated service health verification for all components
- **Error Handling**: Robust error detection and rollback capabilities

### ⚡ CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and deployment workflows
- **Multi-stage Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and Docker builds
- **Security Scanning**: Trivy vulnerability scanning integrated into CI
- **Container Registry**: GitHub Container Registry integration for image storage

### 🏗️ Application Structure
- **React Frontend**: Modern React 18 application with TypeScript support
- **Node.js Backend**: Express server with security middleware and health endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 with initialization scripts and schemas
- **Caching**: Redis 7 for high-performance data caching
- **Load Balancer**: Nginx configuration with rate limiting and SSL readiness

## Technical Verification

### Service Status
All services are running and healthy:
```
✅ Webapp: http://localhost:3000 (Status: Healthy)
✅ Database: localhost:5432 (Status: Connected) 
✅ Redis: localhost:6379 (Status: Connected)
✅ Nginx: http://localhost:80 (Status: Active)
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Service health check
- `GET /api/status` - Application status and feature flags
- All endpoints return JSON responses with proper error handling

### Docker Infrastructure
- Multi-service orchestration working correctly
- Health checks passing for all services
- Volume persistence configured for data retention
- Network isolation and security configured

## Architecture Highlights

### Security Features
- **Helmet.js**: Security headers and CSP policies
- **Rate Limiting**: API and authentication endpoint protection  
- **User Isolation**: Non-root container execution
- **Network Security**: Isolated Docker networks

### Performance Optimizations
- **Multi-stage Docker Build**: Optimized image sizes
- **Nginx Load Balancing**: Request distribution and caching
- **Redis Caching**: High-performance data layer ready
- **Gzip Compression**: Static asset optimization

### Development Experience
- **Hot Reloading**: Development server with live updates
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging with Winston
- **Error Monitoring**: Ready for Sentry integration (Stage 5)
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety for frontend and backend
